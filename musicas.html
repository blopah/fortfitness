                    Eye Of The Tiger Survivor
                    <br>
                    Risin' up, back on the street
                    <br>
                    Did my time, took my chances
                    <br>
                    Went the distance now I'm back on my feet
                    <br>
                    Just a man and his will to survive
                    <br>
                    So many times it happens too fast
                    <br>
                    You change your passion for glory
                    <br>
                    Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
                    <br>
                    You must fight just to keep them alive
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's the eye of the tiger
                    <br>
                    It's the thrill of the fight
                    <br>
                    Rising up to the challenge of our rival
                    <br>
                    And the last known survivor
                    <br>
                    Stalks his prey in the night
                    <br>
                    And he's watching us all
                    <br>
                    With the eye of the tiger
                </p>
                <p>
                    Face to face, out in the heat
                    <br>
                    Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
                    <br>
                    They stack the odds still we take to the street
                    <br>
                    For the kill, with the skill to survive
                </p>

                    Risin' up, straight to the top
                    <br>
                    Had the guts, got the glory
                    <br>
                    Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
